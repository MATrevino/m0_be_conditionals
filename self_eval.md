# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I love these. I definitely feel comfortable with this but would love more practice
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I feel good about this. I'm curious about the third operator in Ruby
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? I feel good, just want more practice
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? I think I spent over 1.5 hours. I spent more time on it because I really want to understand and didn't want to mess up the saving process, etc.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? I'm making a list of topics I feel ok about and will revisit during the next three weeks
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
General question of if there's any suggested practice we can do over the next three weeks.
